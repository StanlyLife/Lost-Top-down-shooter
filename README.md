#Lost-top-down-shooter
This is my second game made in unity.

the game took about a week to make and i used a tutorial and built upon it: https://www.udemy.com/share/101rFSA0Aed1dVTHo=/
The game has alot of sphagetti code and was purely made to improve basic understanding of C# as this is the first time i've writte code or scripts in C# programming language.

the game can be played here: https://stianhave.itch.io/lost
